<h1>Spaceballs</h1>

Do you remember playing in the ballpen as a kid? I do and I remember how much fun my children had too. Well... **SPACEBALLS** kind of creates a similar experience. Put some music on and blast through these balls in space.

## Goal

This is one of the example projects in three.js. It reminded me of that feeling of playing in a ballpen as a kid but somewhere in space. With the right music I felt like I was flying and thought you might enjoy it too.

My goal with this project was to put my javascript knowledge to the test and figure out how to get this working locally and deploy it on a server.
