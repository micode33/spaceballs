# Goal

This is one of the example projects in three.js. It reminds me of that feeling of playing in a ballpen as a kid but somewhere in space. With the right music I felt like I was flying.

My goal with this project was to put my javascript knowledge to the test and figure out how to get this working locally and deploy it to a hosting provider.
